## 1. Foreword

Create by **[Carl](https://github.com/F-Ar1es)**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository is used to hold the code that the proprietor codes. I am a beginner at programming. From now on, I have just learned something from Python. So now it's just a little Python program in this repository.  Possibly after using Python proficiently, I will learn GO or RUST. I will also put them in this repository.

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also fork this repository to make changes yourself. I am pleased to receive suggestions like grammar tunning, pointing out mistakes in programs or some way to study.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine, nice to meet you.
